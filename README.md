## ARM Template for provisioning a Linux Web App with Wordpress connected to Azure Database for MySQL
This template will deploy the following resources into your Azure subscription:

### Wordpress 4.7.2 in a Docker container
### Azure Database for MySQL

If deploying through the **Deploy to Azure** button below, you will have the options to change most of the defaults fairly easily. If deploying through the Azure CLI, it's best that you first clone this repo and edit the **azuredeploy.json** file directly to change the key values to fit your environment.
